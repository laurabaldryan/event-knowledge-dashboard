# Event Knowledge Dashboard
## Overview

The Event Knowledge Dashboard is an interactive data visualization app built with Streamlit.
It enables exploration of structured event data through knowledge graphs, geospatial maps, and temporal timelines.

The dashboard integrates information from:

- event_information_sample.json — structured events extracted from news articles.

- event_taxonomy.json — a hierarchical taxonomy that assigns categories and sentiment values to event types.
